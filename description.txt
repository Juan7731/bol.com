📦 Project Description: Bol.com Order Processing and Excel Export
Objective
Develop a Python, MySQL, or equivalent application that automatically retrieves all orders from Bol.com, processes them, and sorts them into separate Excel (.xlsx) files based on predefined criteria.

🧩 Order Classification
The system must automatically classify each order into one of the following three categories:
Single

The customer orders one item of one EAN

File name: S-XXX.xlsx

SingleLine

The customer orders multiple units of the same EAN

File name: SL-XXX.xlsx

Multi

The customer orders different items / multiple EANs

File name: M-XXX.xlsx

Each day, file numbering starts again from 001.
 Examples:
S-001.xlsx, S-002.xlsx

SL-001.xlsx, M-001.xlsx, etc.

The exact Excel layout and structure are provided in the attached examples and must be followed precisely.

you see in column ‘orderstatus’ the name ‘open’ that is also the status that bol gives you, add that name in the file.

In the Excel layout and structure, you’ll see a column called “Batch Type.”
 This value must match the file name of the Excel file generated for that batch.
As explained earlier, we generate up to three order types each time (if orders are available):
In the morning, the files would be: S-001.xlsx, SL-001.xlsx, and M-001.xlsx.

In the afternoon, new batches are generated as: S-002.xlsx, SL-002.xlsx, and M-002.xlsx.

The corresponding batch number (e.g. 001, 002) must also appear in the Excel sheet in the designated column.
 The Batch Type column should contain the static text value:
Single

SingleLine

Multi
 depending on the file type being generated.

Column explanation:
Column: Description
A: Bol.com order ID
B: Customer name
C: MP EAN (retrieved from Bol.com)
D: Quantity of products for that EAN
E: Shipping label
F: Time of order
G: Category (Single, SingleLine, or Multi)
H: Batch number (as explained above)
I: Bol.com order status — this will always be “open” at the time of order collection


The script (including the Bol.com connection and logic) should be placed in the 
folder:  /data/sites/web/trivium-ecommercecom/FTP/Script

⚙️ Admin Interface (HTML/PHP)
A simple HTML (or PHP) admin page must be created with the following functionality:
 To be hosted at:
 🔗 https://trivium-ecommerce.com/jean.php (“jean” indicates the page location.
This page must be secured with a username and password login.
1st Admin Page
Allow configuration of up to four time slots when orders will automatically be processed and converted into Excel files.

Time fields are optional: if a field is left empty, that time slot will not be used.

Default processing times: 08:30 and 15:01.

2nd Admin Page
Allow configuration of email addresses that will receive the daily summary report.

The system must send an email with the total number of processed orders, based on the orders included in the generated Excel files and the execution time.

The email should go to 2 or 3 recipients, containing a simple summary, e.g.:


 “Today, xxx orders need to be processed.” (we want to be able to adjust that text)
The xxx orders must contain the total orders that you got from bol, so perhaps 
Today, [total_orders] orders need to be processed. and you fill the number between [] so we can change that text. 
 

Email configuration fields should be available for us to fill in manually:

Email address

Reply-to address

Outgoing SMTP server

Port

Connection encryption (TLS)

Authentication type (password)

Username

Password

Optionally, include additional configuration fields (FTP credentials, test mode, etc.).

💾 Output and Notifications
Once the Excel files are generated, they must be automatically uploaded to a specified FTP location: /data/sites/web/trivium-ecommercecom/FTP/Batches

After upload, an email notification should be sent summarizing the total number of orders processed and the generated file names.


🔁 Status Callback Handling
After processing, our external system sends back an HTML status file for each order to a specified FTP location:  /data/sites/web/trivium-ecommercecom/FTP/Callbacks
Each file contains the Bol.com order ID and a status field indicating either:
"verzonden" (sent/shipped), or

"niet verzonden" (not shipped).

When the script detects a file with the status "verzonden", it must automatically update that order’s status in Bol.com via the API.
 This can be done in batches several times per hour, ideally per file, managed by a cron job or scheduler (e.g., once per minute).
Files marked "niet verzonden" should simply be ignored.

🧠 Additional Questions for the Developer
What do you need to enable email sending from the system (SMTP settings, API access, authentication, etc.)?

Do you prefer to build the system in Python or a MySQL-based script?

Should the process be executed via cron job or another type of scheduler?
