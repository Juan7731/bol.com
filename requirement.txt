Bol.com Retailer API Order Automation

I need streamlined, code-level access to the Bol.com Retailer API v10 so my workflow can automatically:

• pull every open order in real time
• generate Bol-approved shipping labels (we ship via “Logistics via Bol”)
• confirm dispatch/returns and push the corresponding “return information when it is sent out” events back to Bol

I already have Bol partner credentials; you just connect, authenticate (OAuth 2.0), and expose clean methods or endpoints that I can drop into my existing system. Language or framework is up to you as long as it’s well-documented and production ready.

Acceptance criteria
1. A small test script shows the three calls above working against my sandbox and then live account.
2. Returned JSON is parsed into simple objects/DTOs; no raw response strings in my business layer.
3. Clear README with setup steps, token refresh logic, and example requests.

If you have previous Bol.com API experience—or can demonstrate fast mastery of v10—let’s get this moving quickly.

And we are looking for a developer to build an automated order processing system for Bol.com, using Python, MySQL, or similar technology.

The system should:

Automatically retrieve all Bol.com orders via API.

Classify each order into one of three categories (Single, SingleLine, Multi) based on quantity and EAN structure.

Generate Excel (.xlsx) files in a specific format (examples provided).

Automatically upload the generated Excel files to an FTP server.

Send email notifications with daily summaries (configurable email settings).

Include a simple HTML/PHP admin page where we can:

Set up to four automated processing times per day.

Manage email and FTP settings.

Additionally, the script must:

Detect HTML status files (via FTP) returned from an external system.

When a file contains status "verzonden", it must update the corresponding Bol.com order status via API (ideally in batches using a cron job or scheduler).

We will provide:

API access details

Excel layout examples

FTP credentials

The full project specification (attached document)

Please apply only if you have experience with API integrations, automated scheduling (cron jobs), and FTP/email handling.
